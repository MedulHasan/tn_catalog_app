# Project Development Challenges & Phases

## Overview

This document outlines the development challenges, phases, and problem-solving approaches encountered during the development of the TN Catalog App. It serves as a reference for understanding the technical hurdles and solutions implemented throughout the project lifecycle.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Configuration

- **Duration**: Initial setup phase
- **Objectives**:
  - React Native project initialization
  - Basic project structure setup
  - Development environment configuration
  - Navigation system setup
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Outcome**: Successfully established the foundation for the catalog app

### Phase 2: Core Features Implementation

- **Duration**: Main development phase
- **Objectives**:
  - INtegrate RTK-query for api request.
  - Implement login system.
  - Product catalog functionality
  - Redux state management implementation
  - Basic UI components development
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Outcome**: Core app functionality working with proper state management

### Phase 3: Map Integration & Platform Compatibility

- **Duration**: Extended troubleshooting phase
- **Objectives**:
  - React Native Maps integration
  - Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
  - Location services implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Completed (with significant challenges)
- **Outcome**: Successfully integrated maps with platform-specific solutions

### Phase 4: Native Module Development

- **Duration**: Learning and implementation phase
- **Objectives**:
  - Custom iOS/Android native module creation
  - Timestamp functionality implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Outcome**: Functional timestamp module with proper native integration

## Major Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: React Native Maps iOS Compatibility

#### Problem Description

The integration of React Native Maps on iOS platform presented significant compatibility issues with React Native version 0.80.1. The latest version introduced breaking changes that caused build failures and runtime errors specifically on iOS devices.

#### Technical Details

- **React Native Version**: Initially 0.80.1
- **React Native Maps Version**: Latest version
- **Platform**: iOS
- **Error Type**: Build failures and runtime compatibility issues

#### Solution Implemented

1. **Version Downgrade Strategy**:
   - Downgraded React Native to version 0.78.2
   - Adjusted React Native Maps to compatible version 1.22.6
   - Ensured all related dependencies were compatible

### Challenge 2: Native Module Development

#### Problem Description

As a developer new to native development, implementing a custom native module for timestamp functionality presented a steep learning curve. The requirement was to create a native iOS module that provides real-time timestamp updates every 20 seconds.

#### Take Assistance from

- **Claude AI**: Used for understanding native module patterns and Swift syntax
- **Cursor IDE**: Leveraged for code generation and debugging assistance
- **Documentation**: Extensive use of React Native and iOS development guides

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Storage Solution

- **Technology**: MMKV
- **Rationale**: High-performance key-value storage for React Native
- **Benefits**: Faster than AsyncStorage, smaller bundle size

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Image Loading

- Implemented `react-native-fast-image` for optimized image loading
- Progressive image loading with placeholder support
- Caching strategies for better performance

### 2. List Performance

- Used `@shopify/flash-list` for high-performance list rendering
- Implemented proper item separation and optimization

### 3. Memory Management

- Proper cleanup in React hooks
- Efficient state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
